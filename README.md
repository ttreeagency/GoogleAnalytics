# Google Analytics TS Object

This package contains a TypoScript object to integrate Google Analytics tracking code in your Neos CMS project.

## How to integrate your tracking code?

Add this to your TypoScript to add the tracking snippet and set your code:

    prototype(Neos.Neos:Page)
        body.javascripts.analytics = Ttree.GoogleAnalytics:TrackingCode {
            trackingCode = 'UA-...'
        }
    }

**Note:** By default the tracking code is included only in ```Production``` context. If you need to include the tracking code
also in ```Development``` context, check the code in [TrackingCode](Resources/Private/Fusion/TrackingCode/TrackingCode.fusion),
you can adjust the Eel expression at ```@if.includeTrackingCode``` as you need.
